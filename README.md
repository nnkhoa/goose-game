# The Goose Game Kata

To run the game, simply type into the command line:
```shell
python game.py
```

You will be asked to enter the player(s) name:
```shell
Add a player:
```

Enter Y or N when asked if another player is needed: 
```shell
Add another players? (Y/N):
```

Once no new player is added, the game will start, and each player will be asked to
roll the dice

When asked for roll (assuming that we have 2 regular 6-side dice), you can input
your own dice roll with the following format ```value 1, value 2``` into the
command line, or just press enter when prompted to have the game auto roll the dice
for you.

The game will finish and declare the winner once a player lands exactly on the last tile(63)
